## This project is for TCS - fresco training
Training url - https://play.fresco.me/course/534 <br/>
Name of fresco training - Vue JS - Apogee<br/>

What is it?<br/>
This training is about to make a vue application in TDD (Test Driven Development) perspective.<br/>
Please note that the only purpose of this project to help the others to increase T-factor from zero to 1.<br/>
Since the main intent to solve all the tests there is a chance the app will not work properly (styles and stuff).<br/>

What to do?<br/>
To finish the hands-on all you have to do is to copy and paste content of all files <br/>
in views & store & router & components directory to the fresco hackerrank project.<br/>
After it's done run npm test if every test passes you are done, submit the project.<br/>
