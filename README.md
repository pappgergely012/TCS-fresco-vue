What is it?
This training is about to make a vue application in TDD (Test Driven Development) perspective.
Please note that the only purpose of this project to help the others to increase T-factor from zero to 1.
Since the main intent to solve all the tests there is a chance the app will not work properly (styles and stuff).

What to do?
To finish the hands-on all you have to do is to copy and paste content of all files 
in views & store & router & components directory to the fresco hackerrank project.
After it's done run npm test if every test passes you are done, submit the project.
